This is an app for friends/colleagues to record and track their scores against each other through a ranking system that allows them to sort through various criteria.

### Steps to get started on Backend:

* Download java 21 : https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows
    * Choose JDK 21. If on windows, download the x64 Installer

* If you want IntelliJ you can download jetbrains tools here https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/, then download intelliJ from the tool. Community is free and should be enough. Enterprise is even better but its licensed.
* if you don't have mvn installed run `./mvnw clean install` on terminal
    * If you already have mvn, make sure the path to the bin is added to your environment variables, and check mvn version with `mvn -v` on terminal. If you want, you can download it here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
        * Run `mvn clean install` to get project installed and ready to run
